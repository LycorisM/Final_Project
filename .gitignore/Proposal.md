## Description
For my final project, I will create a visual/text based point-and-click exploration game called The Maze Path. In this game, the player navigates through a maze-like environment using only three movement commands: Left, Right, and Forward. 

## Features
- Feature 1
  - Bullet Hell/Projectiles while player tries to kill boss
	- Understand Ursina, a commonly used library for making games in Python
- Feature 2
	- A timer displayed during run and and a score calculator that builds the longer you last
- Feature 3 
	- Projectiles from boss enemy, shots from player to damage boss
 - Moving background as the game is running

## Challenges
- Making the side scroller with collidable obstacles that cause the player to take damage
- Importing free to use sprites/images
- Making the boss take damage from player character, moving background

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- Briefly describe what is the ideal outcome?
- The ideal outcome is a moveable character that can shoot and dodge the bullets fired from the boss character

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- Briefly describe the bare essential for a good working outcome?
- Working projectiles, player movement, damage to player and player
- The player is able to move and shoot at the boss.
- The boss takes damage and the boss damage applies damage to the player as well

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Gathering resources such as sprites to import, sound effects, 
  2. Understand Ursina, a commonly used library for making games in Python, Reading and diving deeper into Ursina

- Week 2
  1. Getting core mechanics finalized for the player, moving freely, Up and Down, shooting toward the left side of the screen
  2. Taking damage losing HP when getting hit by none friendly projectiles

- Week N (Final)
  1. Boss Death, Player Death, Game Over, Victory Screen
  2. Scrolling Background and Boss health, taking damage and shooting projectiles, 3 different prjectile types, Random projectile pattern, tracking projectile, straight projectile
