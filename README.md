## Description
My project is a modernized Space Invaders clone that stays faithful to the classic arcade gameplay while introducing a few unique twists to make it stand out. The core experience remains centered around dodging incoming projectiles, managing limited movement space, and clearing waves of descending enemies. To give the game its own identity, I added new enemy variations, dynamic formations, and a pacing system that gradually increases tension. These changes help the game feel familiar yet fresh, maintaining the spirit of the original while offering players something distinct.

The repository is organized for clarity and easy maintenance. The main game file (project.py) contains the game loop, input handling, rendering, and high-level logic. Supporting modules—like player.py and enemy.py—define key behaviors such as movement, collision detection, projectile management, and animation. A settings.py file holds adjustable values for screen size, enemy speed, movement boundaries, and difficulty scaling, allowing convenient fine-tuning without digging through the main code. The assets folder contains sprites, sound effects, and fonts, while optional utility files handle tasks like scoreboard updates or reusable helper functions. This modular layout makes the project easy to navigate and expand.

During development, I focused on making the gameplay feel smooth, responsive, and visually easy to follow even during fast action. Enemy waves were designed with careful timing so that difficulty increases steadily instead of spiking. I chose a clean, retro-inspired art style to ensure projectiles, enemies, and the player ship remain readable at all times. The game’s visual pacing, sound cues, and movement speeds were all tested and adjusted to maintain the “arcade tension” that defines Space Invaders while still feeling comfortable for modern players.

There are several directions I plan to explore for future improvements. These include introducing additional enemy types with new movement formations, expanding the number of wave patterns, and adding a full menu system with adjustable settings. I’d also like to implement a more detailed scoring structure and a persistent high-score table to encourage replayability. While the game is fully functional in its current state, these enhancements would add more depth and polish, further elevating the overall experience.

I've followed a tutorial to create my own type of space invaders video game! The game includes working aliens that move side to side similarly to space invaders. However the aleins do NOT fall or steal the player ship like space invaders. I wanted keep the 8 bit style similary to the original but it takes a more updated tone. I would like to animate my players left to right movements and provide more animation for the enemy aliens

Areas of Improvement
The areas of improvement I want to make for the project is a proper game menu and game over sequence. I had big plans for a boss at the end of the game's level but I was unable to complete the boss as intended due to time constraints. I wanted to include a score keeper and level changes for a boss fight in the feature. Animate
